## Objective
This assignment aims to use Xarray for handling real world climate data in form of NetCDF format. Xarray is an Python Library for performing multidimensional data analysis, handling geospatial coordinates, time series and among other dimensions. NetCDF file format provides xarray with a natural and portable serialization format. NetCDF is very popular in the geosciences.
You will be able to load, visualize, manipulate geospatial multidimensional data through Xarray and Python.
